    <h2>2. Subscription Cancellations</h2>
    <p><strong>Cancellation by You:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting our support team at [Insert Contact Information]. Upon cancellation, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period.</p>
